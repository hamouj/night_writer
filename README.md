# Night Writer

### **Abstract**
---
In this application, the user enters information in the command line and it creates a new file with the English or braille translation.

### **Instructions**
---
If you have an English .txt file for translation:
You need two pieces of information:
1. the name of the file with English text (i.e. english.txt)
2. the name of the file you want to house your braille translation (i.e. braille.txt)

In the command line type 'ruby ./**lib/night_writer.rb (1) (2)**

If you have a braille .txt file for translation:
You need two pieces of information:
1. the name of the file with braille text (i.e. braille.txt)
2. the name of the file you want to house your English translation (i.e. english.txt)

In the command line type 
**'ruby ./lib/night_reader.rb (1) (2)**

### **Wins & Challenges**
---
Figuring out how to use files was difficult. I also struggled with writing tests, but got a lot of practice with stubs! The win for me was getting all of the functionality within my project.

### **Future Iterations**
---
1. Having a check for files that are not in English or Braille
1. Supporting punctuation within translation
